# Algorithms_practice + CHEAT SHEETS

## Description

Go ahead and use different version of algorithms I wrote practicing them. 
Every jupyternotebook file includes the source I used, eg. geeksforgeeks, tutorialspoint and more.
You can also use my notes as cheat sheets. Writing down the reasoning and following with every line of the code with the commentary helped me a lot.

### Practice makes perfect.
